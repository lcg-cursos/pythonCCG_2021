DESCRIPTION
    This programs gets a dna sequence and returns the AT rich regions of it.

CATEGORY
     DNA sequence analysis

USAGE
    None

ARGUMENTS
    None

INPUT
    The dna sequence given by the user

OUTPUT
    Those regions of the dna sequence that are AT rich

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: gets CTGCATTATATCGTACGAAATTATACGCGCG and returns ATTATAT
                                                                AAATTATA
