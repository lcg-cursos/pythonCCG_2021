DESCRIPTION
	[Program that, given a DNA chain, returns the count of bases, adenine, guanine, citosine and thymine]

CATEGORY
	[sequence analysis]

USAGE
	[Conta_Bases.py][-options/arguments]

ARGUMENTS
	[dna]  [variable that will save the input given. Presumably a DNA chain]
    
INPUT
	[DNA chain saves in the input variable dna]
    
OUTPUT
    [Nucleotide bases named after their first letter along with the number of times it appears in the input sequence]
    
EXAMPLES
    [Example 1: given a DNA sequence like , AAGGAUGTCGCGCGTTATTAGCCTAA
    output > A: 7 , C: 5 , G: 7 , T: 6]
