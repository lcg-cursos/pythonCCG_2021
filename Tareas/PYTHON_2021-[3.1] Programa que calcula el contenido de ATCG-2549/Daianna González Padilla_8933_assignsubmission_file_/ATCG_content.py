DESCRIPTION
    This programs gets a dna sequence as input and returns as output the content of each nucleotide
    of the sequence

CATEGORY
     DNA sequence analysis

USAGE
    None

ARGUMENTS
    This program doesn't take arguments

INPUT
    The DNA sequence given by the user

OUTPUT
    The results are printed on screen

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: gets ATTCGCCC and returns "The A content of the sequence is: 1"
                                         "The T content of the sequence is: 2"
                                         "The C content of the sequence is: 4"
                                         "The G content of the sequence is: 1"
